Vue Headless UI is a MIT licensed project that is developed and maintained by Ioan-Horia Rotaru.

The idea behind this project is to allow the users to style their components in whatever way they want to without
writing massive amounts of **JavaScript**.

This library is heavily inspired by [Headless UI ](https://headlessui.dev/)  created by the team
at [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and falls within the same scope with the addition of more components and a focus
on from inputs.

The only dependency of this library is [VeeValidate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/). This is due to the form
inputs needing a robust and reliable method of validation.

This library is written in **TypeScript** and **ONLY** supports **Vue 3**.

## Documentation

Docs are available at https://horia16.github.io/vue-headless-ui-docs  - this it still very early in development and
might change in the future.

## Installation

Use npm or yarn to install the library.

```bash

npm install vue-headless-ui

```

or

```bash

yarn add vue-headless-ui

```

## Example Usage

```typescript

import  {  defineComponent,  ref  }  from  "vue";

import  {  HeadlessInput,  InputField,  InputLabel,  InputError  }  from  "vue-headless-ui";

export  default  defineComponent({

name:  "HelloWorld",

components:  { HeadlessInput, InputField, InputLabel, InputError },

...

```

And in the template

```html

<headless-input  v-model="model">

<input-label  text="Example Label" />

<input-field />

<input-error />

</headless-input>

```
